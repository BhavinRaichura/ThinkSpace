- **Drawing Tools:** Users can draw using a pencil tool or choose from predefined shapes like line, circle, and rectangle.
- **Undo/Redo:** Users can undo or redo drawing operations.
- **Customization:** Users can customize drawing properties such as color, thickness, and opacity.
- **Optimized Rendering:** Utilizes SVG instead of Canvas for optimized rendering and reduced rerendering.
- **Local Storage:** Drawing data is saved to local storage, associated with a room ID, ensuring persistence across sessions.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing for rapid development and customization.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS:** Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
